<div>
The policy documents represented in this web annotation tool are open source and have been adapted from the original published sources. 
<ul>
<li>The ODRL web specification has been used to model normative statements in this annotation tool. The rules formulated are specific to certain relevant text and sections in the policy documents that are important.</li>
<li>The entire document cannot be annotated actively. Only main sections of the document that are relevant to interpretation can be annotated. The text between the "BEGIN" and "END" labels are open to be actively annotated. Other parts of the text are merely static.</li>
